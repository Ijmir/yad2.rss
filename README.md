#Yad2 RSS API

##What?
This project is aimed for those who're searching for an apartment and tired of refreshing [Yad2](http://yad2.co.il) manually during the day.

##How?
Sinatra server, Poltergeist and Capybara.

###Prerequisites
PhantomJS >= 1.8

###Starting the server
```
bundle install
rackup
```
###Creating a feed:
Go to [Yad2](http://yad2.co.il), filter your ads using the search and copy the query parameter.

Your RSS feed will be constructed as follow:  
`http://localhost:9292/yad2/<ad_type>.rss?<query_parameters>`.

Where:

* `<ad_type>` can be either `rent` or `sales`
* `<query_parameters>` is the exact string that is yad2's query parameters

For example, the RSS url for [this](http://www.yad2.co.il/Nadlan/rent.php?AreaID=&City=&HomeTypeID=&fromRooms=&untilRooms=&fromPrice=100&untilPrice=200&PriceType=1&FromFloor=&ToFloor=&EnterDate=&Info=)
search is:
`http://localhost:9292/yad2/rent.rss?AreaID=&City=&HomeTypeID=&fromRooms=&untilRooms=&fromPrice=100&untilPrice=200&PriceType=1&FromFloor=&ToFloor=&EnterDate=&Info=`


Use your favorite news reader to serve it.
It is worth noting here that your news reader update rate should approximately match the amount of ads your yad2 search filters.

This project is based on [@shaiguitar](http://github.com/shaiguitar)'s old project that aimed to achieve the same goal.
